# CyberTraining
This repository contributes to (i) prepare, nurture, and grow the national scientific research workforce for creating, utilizing, and supporting advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) that enables potentially transformative fundamental science and engineering research in Freshwater,  (ii) ensure broad adoption of CI tools, methods, and resources by the fundamental science and engineering research community to enable new modes of discovery; and (iii) integrate core literacy and discipline-appropriate advanced skills in advanced CI as well as computational and data science and engineering into the Nationâ€™s educational curriculum/instructional material fabric spanning undergraduate and graduate courses. This contributes to the Nation's overall economic competiveness and security, as understanding hydrologic processes and distributing information about water resources is fundamental to community, environmental, and public well-being.
